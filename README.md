- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @codxJC
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ServiceNow, and web and software development.
- ðŸ¥‡ Iâ€™m a NextGen ServiceNow graduate.
- ðŸ¥‡ Also, a student at Codecademy studying the software engineer path at my free time. 
- ðŸ¥‡ Bonus points: Learning html, CSS, Javascript, Angular, Bootstrap, APIs and other technologies, will definitely help me advance my skills in ServiceNow, either as a system administrator/configurator or a developer.
